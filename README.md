# programming-for-data-analysis-assignment
This will contain the jupiter notebook assignment for this module.
For the jupiter note book you will be able to run and see the output from the investigation into Numpy.
While there are many Distrbuted funtions in Numpy the focus of this report will be on:
Uniform, Normal, Poisson, Binomial and Bernoulli. 
Running the note requires a knowledge of working with jupiter but in the code cell pressing ctrl and enter will run each cell.
